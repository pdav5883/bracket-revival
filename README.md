## Computing Points

## Questions/Misc Thoughts
- If you change your pick to have a team keep going when you had them going out, should you get all the bonus?
	- No bonus should be awarded based on when the pick is made, not whether you correctly picked the team to this point. If you switch a pick in the current round, that pick should always be worth 1.
