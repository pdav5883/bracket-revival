      <h1 class="scroll-offset-target" id="overview">About <em>bracket-revival</em></h1>
      <p>A celebration of the premier friends and family sport picking competition on the US calendar, <em>bracket-revival</em> is the scientifically-proven best way to experience March Madness without the sadness of seeing all your Final Four teams wiped out in the first weekend. Before every round, you get to re-do all your picks, so your bracket is never busted!</p>

      <h3 class="scroll-offset-target" id="rules">Rules</h3>
      <p>See the whole page of rules <a href="/rules.html">HERE</a>. Perfect for some light bedtime reading.</p>

      <h3 class="scroll-offset-target" id="pages">Navigating Pages</h3>
      <p>To play <em>bracket-revival</em> you'll need to <a href="/newplayer.html">Join a Game</a>. If it's currently early March you'll be able to join one of several games. Otherwise you can join any of the Historical competitions for previous years to test your March memory.</p>

      <p>Once you join a game, you'll make picks on the <a href="/picks.html">Picks</a> page, where you click to select winners of games in each round.</p>

      <p>Check how you're doing against fellow competitors on the <a href="/scoreboard.html">Scoreboard</a> page. From there you can look at how your <a href="/bracket.html">Bracket</a> looks across rounds and games. You can click on each game to see your picks across your various rounds of picks, as well as see how many points you've won for each game.</a>
      
      <h3 class="scroll-offset-target" id="format">Formatting</h3>
      <p>All of the brackets you see on the <a href="/picks.html">Picks</a> and <a href="/bracket.html">Bracket</a> pages use a Javascript library called <a href="https://bracketry.app">Bracketry</a>, which is the most-capable and best-documented library I could find for bracket visualization. Bracketry is focused on tennis tournament brackets, but has plenty of flexibility to make it usable as a College Basketball bracket picking interface. Free software is amazing!</p>

      <p>The rest of the formatting for <em>bracket-revival</em> is built on the <a href="">Bootstrap</a> framework. I've barely scratches the surface of what Bootstrap offers, but the pieces that are used here provide a much better UI than the rest of BLR.</p>
